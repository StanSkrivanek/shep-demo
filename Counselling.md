Welcome to Coiscéim, a confidential and affordable Counselling program operated by SHEP.

Counselling is a form of therapy where a trained psychotherapist actively listens to you, providing support as you navigate through the challenges you may be facing. During sessions, you are encouraged to express your feelings and emotions openly, while being assured of a judgment-free and supportive environment. 

These sessions take place in a secure and confidential setting, fostering a space where you can explore your thoughts and experiences. The aim is to help you gain a deeper understanding of your situation, empowering you to work towards a resolution.

Our Counselling services are here to assist you with a variety of concerns, such as:

Feeling troubled or stressed, and seeking a better way forward

Coping with the loss of a loved one or other significant losses- Managing challenging emotions, including low self

Esteem or anger- Addressing relationship difficulties

Processing trauma, such as experiences of verbal, physical, or sexual abuse

Exploring aspects of sexual or gender identity

Confidentiality
At Coiscéim, your privacy is of utmost importance. All personal information shared during Counselling sessions is treated with the strictest confidence. Our Referral Officers, who conduct assessments, are trained counselors themselves. 

Additionally, the counselors on our panel are ethically bound to practice in accordance with the Code of Ethics of their professional organizations and adhere to the principles and policies of Coiscéim.


While confidentiality is maintained in most situations, there are specific circumstances where it may be limited.

Types Of Counselling

In the realm of Counselling and psychotherapy, practitioners utilize various theoretical approaches to facilitate their work with clients. Research has consistently shown that the quality of the therapeutic relationship formed between the client and the practitioner holds paramount importance, often superseding the specific therapeutic approach employed.

Integrative Therapy

Many counsellors employ an integrative approach, combining distinct models of Counselling and psychotherapy. This approach allows for a tailored treatment plan, drawing from multiple therapeutic methods to suit the unique needs of the client.

Humanistic Therapy

Rooted in the personal growth movement, humanistic therapy encourages individuals to introspect about their feelings, thoughts, and actions. Emphasizing self-development and realizing one's highest potential, this therapy often adopts a "Client-Centered" or "Non-Directive" approach, focusing on the person as a whole.

Mindfulness

Mindfulness encourages intentional attention to thoughts, helping individuals intercept negative thought patterns. By creating mental space and awareness, mindfulness disrupts the chain reaction of negative thoughts, allowing individuals to center themselves in the present moment. Therapists practicing mindfulness often have a background in meditation.

Person-Centered Therapy

Developed by Carl Rogers, this approach enables clients to confront negative feelings that might be causing emotional distress. The objective is for clients to recognize their power and freedom to change, emphasizing personal agency over external factors.

Psychodynamic Psychotherapy/Counselling

This approach delves into the unconscious mind and past experiences, shaping present behavior. Clients explore childhood relationships, focusing on the client-therapist relationship dynamics, particularly the concept of transference. Transference involves projecting past feelings onto the therapist, aiding in quicker resolutions to emotional challenges.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

CBT combines cognitive and behavioral techniques, teaching clients to modify thought patterns and expectations. Additionally, relaxation techniques are employed. CBT has proven effective for stress-related issues, phobias, obsessions, eating disorders, and major depression, often used alongside drug treatments.

Gestalt Therapy

Gestalt therapy considers the entirety of a client’s experience, including emotions, thoughts, and actions. Clients gain self-awareness by analyzing their behavior, body language, and expressing suppressed emotions. The focus lies on the present moment, fostering holistic self-discovery.

Each of these approaches offers a unique lens through which therapists help clients navigate their challenges. By understanding these theoretical frameworks, clients and therapists collaboratively choose the approach that resonates most with the client's needs and goals.## Counselling panel
